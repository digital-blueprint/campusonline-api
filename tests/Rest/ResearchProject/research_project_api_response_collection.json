To address this problem, we propose purpose tagging as a novel kind of tagging that focuses on capturing aspects of intent rather than content. By capturing the different purposes a given resource can serve, purpose tags appear useful to mediate between the vocabulary of user intent on one hand, and the vocabulary of contents and tags provided by social software applications on the other. The paper at hand makes the following contributions: 1) It extends the set of known kinds of tags with a novel type and 2) it provides first empirical evidence of the principle feasibility of purpose tagging and its potential to facilitate goal-oriented social search in an exploratory case study.", "BEGINN": { "value": "2008-03-17" }, "ENDE": { "value": "2010-09-17" }, "SPRACHE": "EN" } } }

The\r\nconsequences of spinal cord injury are tremendous for these individuals. The loss of motor functions especially of the arm\r\nand grasping function – 40% are tetraplegics – leads to a life-long dependency on care givers and therefore to a dramatic\r\ndecrease in quality of life in these often young individuals. With the help of neuroprostheses, grasp and elbow function can\r\nbe substantially improved. However, remaining body movements often do not provide enough degrees of freedom to control\r\nthe neuroprosthesis.\r\nThe ideal solution for voluntary control of an upper extremity neuroprosthesis would be to directly record motor commands\r\nfrom the corresponding cortical areas and convert them into control signals. This would realize a technical bypass around\r\nthe interrupted nerve fiber tracts in the spinal cord.\r\nA Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) transform mentally induced changes of brain signals into control signals and serve as an\r\nalternative human-machine interface. We showed first results in EEG-based control of a neuroprosthesis in several persons\r\nwith SCI in the last decade, however, the control is still unnatural and cumbersome.\r\nThe objective of FEEL YOUR REACH is to develop a novel control framework that incorporates goal directed movement\r\nintention, movement decoding, error processing, processing of sensory feedback to allow a more natural control of a\r\nneuroprosthesis. To achieve this aim a goal directed movement decoder will be realized, and continuous error potential\r\ndecoding will be included. Both will be finally joined together with an artificial kinesthetic sensory feedback display attached\r\nto the user. We hypothesize that with these mechanisms a user will be able to naturally control an neuroprosthesis with his/\r\nher mind only.", "BEGINN": { "value": "2016-05-01" }, "ENDE": { "value": "2021-04-30" }, "SPRACHE": "EN" } } }

The interdisciplinary project, involving 17 universities at present (August 2018), aims to build up cooperation between universities in order to work on the SDGs in a more targeted manner. The scientific basis for guiding political decisions and for developing meaningful measures for SDG implementation will be provided by the participating universities in order to support achievement of the SDGs. In order to build on existing expertise, it is important to know the status quo of available sustainability research. During the past months, we have been working on a digital map of research activities related to sustainability topics, based on the definition of the SDGs. The aim of this approach is to identify current focus areas as well as underrepresented research fields related to SDGs to provide universities with a basis for targeted sustainability research. The results are directly integrated into the activities in the frame of the project UniNEtZ. ", "BEGINN": { "value": "2019-01-01" }, "ENDE": { "value": "2021-12-31" }, "SPRACHE": "EN" } } }

MICROBIOMESUPPORT will follow the approach of food system and integrate actors and experts from all stages in this circular economy of food. The food system approach is part of the FOOD 2030 concept to promote a systems approach to research and innovation (R&I). MICROBIOMESUPPORT will be one of the key drivers to implement FOOD 2030 strategies, will facilitate multi-actor engagement to align, structure and boost R&I in microbiome and will support the European Commission by coordinating the activities, meetings, workshops and results from the International Bioeconomy Forum (IBF) working group ‘Food Systems Microbiome’. The main concept behind MICROBIOMESUPPORT IS to boost the bioeconomy and the FOOD 2030 strategy, by focusing on the new avenues generated by microbiome R&I efforts. MICROBIOMESUPPORT WILL have a main impact on the coordination of commonly defined R&I agendas which will be incorporated into regional, national, European but also global funding programmes related to microbiomes in food systems. MICROBIOMESUPPORT will create a collaborative international network and integrate know-how in plant, terrestrial, animal, human and aquatic microbiome R&I as well as expertise in bioeconomy applications. MICROBIOMESUPPORT has integrated international partners form Brazil, Canada, South Africa, China, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, India and USA in order to improve the international cooperation and coordination of common bioeconomy research programmes and set a basis for common microbiome R&I agendas.", "BEGINN": { "value": "2018-11-01" }, "ENDE": { "value": "2022-10-31" }, "SPRACHE": "EN" } } }
